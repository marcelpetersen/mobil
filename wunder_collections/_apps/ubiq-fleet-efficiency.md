description: "<p>Most shared mobility services aren’t profitable. Ubiq's data-driven
  services address this by automating operations to ensure vehicles are in the right
  place, at the right time, to meet demand. This enables operators to increase fleet
  monetization and decrease operational costs.</p><p>Whatever your operational needs
  are, Ubiq can add value. This could be intelligence to help existing service teams
  work more effectively or, for operators looking for a more hands-off approach, Ubiq
  has established the StreetCrowd: Crowdsourced operations executed by citizens.</p><p>-----
  Solutions include: Automated Rebalancing (intelligence only or with optional StreetCrowd
  app), Predictive Charging (StreetCrowd app) and Dynamic Pricing ---</p>"

  title: Leverage the power of the crowd to exploit the full potential of your fleet.
  screenshot_description: "Ubiq created StreetCrowd: Allowing citizens to contribute
    hands-on to the future of shared mobility. Through StreetCrowd, Ubiq matches vehicles
    requiring repositioning, or charging, with crowd users, allowing shared mobility
    operators to automate operations. By leveraging the power of the crowd,  mobility
    providers have access to scalable, decentralized operations that run 24/7, across
    the city. \n\n*The service can also be used by operational teams."
